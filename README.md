# WORDLE-
The Wordle Game Backend is built using Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), PostgreSQL, and Django AllAuth for authentication. It provides a RESTful API for game logic, user authentication, and leaderboard tracking. The project structure includes key directories like game/ for game-related logic, wordle_project/ for settings, and templates/ for email and authentication templates. To set up, clone the repository, create a virtual environment, install dependencies from requirements.txt, configure the .env file with SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, and ALLOWED_HOSTS, and apply migrations using python manage.py migrate. Load the word list with python manage.py load_words before starting the server with python manage.py runserver. The admin panel is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/, and a superuser can be created using python manage.py createsuperuser. The API is documented with Swagger at http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/ and Redoc at http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/. Key API endpoints include authentication (/accounts/signup/, /accounts/login/, /accounts/logout/) and game actions (/api/game/start/, /api/game/guess/, /api/game/leaderboard/).
